This is an API that consumes the AGCO's Telemetry API, and exposes the Equipament information as a JSON RESTful endpoint.
It is developed on top of [node.js](https://nodejs.org).

# Executing

The API is requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be executed, and a C compiler to install some libraries with native bindings.

To start a webserver on a given port, execute the following:

```bash
npm install # Ensures that dependencies are installed
PORT=1234 npm start
```

The server will be running at: http://0.0.0.0:1234

## Developing

The API is requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be developed.

To start the development server, you can execute:

```bash
npm install # Ensures that dependencies are installed
npm run start-dev
```

This will start a server listening on http://localhost:9090 and will reload the
server when it noticies file changes.

The codebase contains tests, and to validate changes, you may execute:

```bash
npm install # Ensures that dependencies are installed
npm test # Triggers package analisys, lints and tests
```
